| Feature Id | Feature |
| -----------|---------|
|F_01| Option to load older saved data |
|F_02| Save data to file if only new data is added |
|F_03| Update data in list and file(if in file) |
|F_04| Deleting record automatically updates Record file and Index File |
|F_05| New records gets saved in file at program shut down |
|F_06| Before program shut down all memory is freed and clean |
|F_07| Used Binary File System for quick access to files |
|F_08| Search of Data is possible from both List and file |
|F_09| Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation implemented |

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome
| No. | Challenge | Solution
|-----|-----------|--------
|1. | Code Crashed without any error message (Segmentation Fault) | GDB tool helped to pin point the Invalid Read 
|2. | After program shut down, there was no way to recover data | Implemented File System |
|3. | IOWITHOUTPOSITIONING Error | Check if fseek() != -1 between consecutive read and write calls
|4. | Structure Padding causing write to uninitialized location(Still Reachable code error) | Won't Fix, need help
|5. | Requirement gathering proved to be challenging, mainly ageing | Read multiple Research papers to find about history of management systems 
|6. | gcov generating *.gcda and *.gcno files in different directory than object file | added few extra steps in make file under coverage, made a copy of .c file in current directory and ran coverage then deleted all the unnecessary files.
